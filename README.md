# Invoice Management System
#### Video Demo: (https://youtu.be/fNbJ1AGFXWo)
#### Description:

This project is a simple Invoice Management System built using Pythonâ€™s Flask framework, the Peewee ORM, SQLite for storage, and Tailwind CSS for styling. It also uses WeasyPrint to generate professional-looking PDF invoices. The purpose of this project is to show how a small but complete web application can be built from scratch. It combines database models, CRUD operations, templates, and styling into one system.

The system is designed for small businesses, freelancers, or anyone who wants to manage invoices without depending on external software. The features are kept simple but still demonstrate many of the same principles used in larger, professional applications.

<h3>What the Project Does</h3>

The application allows users to:

Add customers with their name, email, and address.

Create invoices automatically when a new customer is added.

Add items to invoices, including description, quantity, and price.

Update totals for invoices whenever items are created, updated, or deleted.

Edit or delete both customers and items.

List invoices and view them either on the web or as downloadable PDF files.

Use a clean interface that works on different screen sizes and feels modern thanks to Tailwind CSS.

The end result is a small web-based invoice manager that you can run locally.
